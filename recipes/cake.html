            <li>Spread batter evenly in the prepared baking pan.</li>

            <li>Remove cake from oven and place on a wire rack. Using a chopstick or straw, poke holes about 1-inch apart all over the cake. Drizzle glaze over the cake and spread evenly. Let cake cool completely on wire rack, about 1 hour.</li>
