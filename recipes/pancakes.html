        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>A pancake, also known as a hotcake, griddlecake, or flapjack, is a flat type of batter bread like cake, often thin and round, prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs, milk, and butter, and then cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>    
            <li>Leaveners</li>    
            <li>Salt</li>    
            <li>Buttermilk</li>    
            <li>Milk</li>    
            <li>Eggs</li>    
            <li>Butter</li>    
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients</strong>: Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
            <li><strong>Mix the wet ingredients</strong>: Beat the buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl. Do not combine the wet and dry ingredients until right before you cook the pancakes.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the pancakes</strong>: Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix with a wooden spoon or fork until the mixtures are just-blended. Scoop the batter onto a hot, oiled griddle and cook until the pancake is bubbly on the top. Flip with a spatula and cook until both sides are brown.</li>
        </ol>
